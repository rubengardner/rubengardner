## 🚀 About Me

I’m a backend-focused full-stack developer passionate about building clean, scalable systems and smart automation tools. My work spans asynchronous data infrastructure, CLI tooling, AI-powered simulations, and intuitive frontend experiences.  

When I’m not coding, I’m probably climbing rocks or exploring new matcha spots.
